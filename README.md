# AI Constitution

This repository contains an open AI Constitution template designed to serve as a
foundational governance layer for AI systems, autonomous agents, and developer
platforms.

The Constitution provides:

- Core values and guiding principles
- Behavioral directives
- Safety and risk policies
- Persona and identity rules
- Interaction guidelines
- Autonomy and agent constraints
- Governance and versioning structure
- Extension modules for domain-specific policies

## Purpose

The goal of this Constitution is to offer a clear, adaptable, and permissive
framework that can be embedded into AI projects at any scale. It is written to
be technology-agnostic and model-agnostic, suitable for LLMs, agents, and
multi-persona systems.

This Constitution is released under a **CC0 Public Domain Dedication** so that
anyone may freely copy, modify, extend, or incorporate it into their own work —
